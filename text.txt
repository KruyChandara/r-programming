The water levels along the Mekong River in Thailand, Laos and Cambodia are set to drop due to decreased outflows at the Jinghong hydropower station in China’s Yunnan province as China conducts maintenance on its power grid infrastructure from January 5 to 24.A statement from the inter-governmental Mekong River Commission (MRC) on January 6 announced that the maintenance would result in a reduced water flow of 1,000 cubic metres per second (m3/s) from January 5-24, citing information from China’s Ministry of Water Resources.The flow rate will gradually return to normal from January 25, but the ministry did not specify river levels before the reduction or the volume to be restored, the statement said.As a result, water levels along the Mekong River are likely to drop by about 1.2m, according to MRC’s observations and forecasting of water level data,” it said.Water levels had already dropped by almost 2m during January 2-4 at the Chiang Saen monitoring station in Thailand, located approximately 300km downstream from Jinghong. The level is expected to rise 0.05m from January 5-11.
